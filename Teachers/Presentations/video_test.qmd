## My First Quarto Document

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Adding numbers together

Define variables

```{r}
a = 1
b = 3
```

Look at the variables

```{r}
print(a)
print(b)
```

Making a new variable, c, which is the sum of a and b

```{r}
# This line will not be excecuted because of the hashtag
c = a + b 
```

Look at the newly defined variable, c

```{r}
print(c)
```
