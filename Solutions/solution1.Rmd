```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE)
```

## Basic R commands

```{r include=FALSE}
#do this to load the data
data(trees)
library(tidyverse)
```


11. How many trees do we have data for?
```{r}
nrow(trees)
```

12. Now, extract the column called volume from the dataset and assign it to a new variable called volume_col.

```{r}
volume_col <- trees$Volume
```

13. Display the volume of the first 10 trees.

```{r}
head(volume_col, n = 10)
```    
    
14. Find the minimum, maximum and mean volume from the column you just extracted. 
    
```{r}
min(volume_col)
max(volume_col)
mean(volume_col)
```

15. What class of datastructure is trees? Make it into a tibble.
```{r}
class(trees)
trees <- as_tibble(trees)
```
